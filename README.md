# Sushi IoT Board

**Sushi Board is an ESP32-based programmable modular embedded system for general-purpose IoT, suitable for STEM education and DIY electronics projects.**
100% based on widely available commercial modules, making it cost-effective and easy to source.

## For MAKERs
* A carrier board that connect all the essential components needed to create a complete IoT unit, suitable for various applications, minimizing the complexity of assembling different components and boards without requiring extensive soldering or wiring.
* Only the CPU is mandatory; then you simply plug in the modules you need for your specific purposes.

## For students and educational purposes
* Sushi Board offers a modular system that can be shared across multiple projects, from simple setups to more complex, DIY electronics systems. 
* It’s not just for desk experiments; you can build something practical and functional.

## Advantages
* Based on ESP32 SoC: a reliable choice in the IoT field. You have access to a powerful ecosystem with numerous resources available online.
* 100% based on very common commercial modules widely available online for Arduino and DIY electronics projects. Sushi board just help you connect them all together.
* You can code with your favourite compiler : Arduino, microPython (even without a PC), Scratch, ESP-IDF, etc. 
* Open source hardware: both the CPU module and the Sushi Board come with wiring diagrams provided.
  
## Applications
* Generic IoT & sensors educational experiment
* Fast prototyping
* Home automation systems
* IoT central units
* Alarm systems
* Domotics servers
* Remote monitoring and data sampling systems (example weather centrals)
